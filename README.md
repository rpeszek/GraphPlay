# GraphPlay
Polymorphic graph ideas - work in progress (just starting to play with this stuff)

My play-project to do graph things using Haskell and higher level polymorphism.
This is my first non-'hello world' Haskell project.

Why this topic?
Typical graph libraries think about a graph as a 'data structure'.
This maybe important for performance but is limiting. I want to investigate more polymorphic representations of graphs.
Data-structure like graph designs are forced to make stuctual decisions about what is a vertex and what is an edge. 
I find it less than ideal.  More Polymorphic approach should allow me to keep types closer to a Graph Theory textbook.

Hope to make this project grow over this summer.
