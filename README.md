# GraphPlay

WORK IN PROGRESS. I made it a public folder for my colleagues to follow along.

Project to play and experiment with graphs, polymorphism, and Haskell language.
Trying to look at graphs not as 'data structures'.

Project uses somewhat unusual folder structure:  
* src - contains PolyGraph.xyz modules with mostly polymorphic type class level
* examples - contain Play.xyz modules for ghci use to play with the PolyGraph
* test - is a TODO

My first non-'hello world' Haskell project!  Learning a TON and having lots of fun.
