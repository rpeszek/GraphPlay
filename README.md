# PolyGraph
Project to play and experiment with graphs, polymorphism, and Haskell language.
Trying to look at graphs not as 'data structures'.

Project uses somewhat unusual folder structure:  
* src - contains PolyGraph.xyz modules with mostly polymorphic type class level
* examples - contain Play.xyz modules for ghci use to play with the PolyGraph
* test - is a TODO

My first non-'hello world' Haskell project.

WORK IN PROGRESS.
